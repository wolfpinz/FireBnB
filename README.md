### FireBnB
This MVP of of an AirBnB clone was developed during week 7 of Le Wagon's fullstack web development bootcamp, where - for the first time - all the learnings came together to build a fullstack app. (Albeit a humble one. But hey, not too bad after 6 weeks of learning to code, right?!)

This included especially, but not exhaustively:
- developing clear user stories & journeys
- wireframing
- creating the DB schema
- creating routes, controllers and models in Rails
- handling Authentication & Authorization
- using a CDN to host assets (allow users to upload images)
- building a multi-page, nontrivial front-end using Bootstrap & Sass
- hosting and continously deploying on Heroku
- and of course: collaborating in and as a team. working on one codebase, really using GitHub
